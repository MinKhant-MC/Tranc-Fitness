## Google Sheet Setup

Create one new Google Sheet for this gym system.

Then in Apps Script:

1. Create a new Apps Script project.
2. Paste `google-apps-script/Code.gs`.
3. Paste `google-apps-script/appsscript.json`.
4. Replace `PASTE_GYM_SHEET_ID_HERE` in `Code.gs` with your new gym Google Sheet ID.
5. Run `setupGymManagementSystem()`.
6. Authorize the script.
7. Deploy as Web App:
   - Execute as: Me
   - Who has access: Anyone

## Frontend Setup

In `config.js`, replace:

```js
API_URL: 'PASTE_GYM_APPS_SCRIPT_WEB_APP_URL_HERE'
```

with your deployed Apps Script web app URL.

## Default Admin Login

- Username: `admin`
- Password: `admin123`

Change this directly in the `Admins` sheet after setup if you want.

## Member Login

After approval:

- Identifier: member phone number
- Password: member password set during registration

Member sessions are remembered on the same device until logout.
Member dashboard data is cached locally for 1 day on that device.

## Important Notes

- QR attendance scanning works best on HTTPS hosting.
- Member expiry notifications are shown inside the dashboards for both admin and member.
- Activities are seeded automatically when you run setup.
